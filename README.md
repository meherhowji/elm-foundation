#Elm Foundation
> Elm foundation is an elm module for using the hottest UI Framework on the planet, Foundation. The project aims to deliver a complete foundation platform. It's a mountain of a task and I thought to begin with the most essential and core idea of Foundation Sites ie X Y Grid. XY Grid is interesting because it takes its cues from the next version of CSS.
